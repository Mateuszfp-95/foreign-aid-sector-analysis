Foreign Aid Allocation Analysis: Sectoral and Geographical Trends (2000–2023)

How do donor countries allocate foreign aid across sectors and regions, and what patterns emerge over time?

Problem Statement
Foreign aid plays a critical role in supporting economic and social development around the world. However, the strategic choices that donor countries make—such as which sectors or regions to prioritize—can have profound implications for global development, equity, and geopolitics.

This project investigates how donor countries allocate foreign aid across key sectors (e.g., health, education, infrastructure) and recipient regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America). It seeks to uncover patterns and trends in aid distribution and offer visual insights on sectoral and geographical priorities.
